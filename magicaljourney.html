<div style="text-align:left;">
<div style="text-align:left;width:743px;height:951px;">
<font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">I was combing through the markup languosphere the other day. You might know the activity as "browsing the web", or maybe by the more common euphemism, "tickling the plump hypertext neckwaddle of the corpulent Mayor of Cybersurf City". I had him tittering and giggling, rolling about on his back as if a large humanoid bean. I was doing that with a kind of boyish, carefree abandon, until I ran into...</font><p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">THIS:
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;">
<img src="bc75003e503493abeafd0079bfb113f8c5f4498f.gif" style="height:90px;width:728px;text-align:left;"/></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">This is the type of thing that has become invisible to everyone else, and is quickly dismissed. But not to me. I am sort of like the Dr. David Livingstone of the internet. This was enough to have me gathering my safari helmet and my array of delicate nettings for ensnaring any precious fauna that might flutter by.
</font>
</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Yes, there may be some other intrepid souls out there who would click on such a thing out of pure curiosity. But their pioneering spirit dries up there, as no sane person would go any further for the very reasonable fear of treacheries ahead. But I am not that person. I'm the type to fling myself headlong through the magical wardrobe, and then incinerate the ornate mahogany portal behind me with a Molotov cocktail.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Specifically, I got to asking myself the question, "What happens when you click on these spastic bullshit ads for promos of marginal value and merit,
<i style="text-align:left;">and then actually pursue the process to its end?</i>" This is the bottomless rabbit hole into which I've sunken my soft, vulnerable torso.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">And I have returned. I have come back to chronicle my odyssey for those who would never dream of embarking on one themselves. I do it so you don't have to, and because you don't want to. And believe me. You really
<i style="text-align:left;">don't</i>
want to.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">But that's because you're all a bunch of huge pussies. Personally, I LOVE adventure!</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Ok, let's break it down piece by piece, and take a good hard look at this. Rome was not offered for free with the completion of one or more promotional offers in a day. I'll start at the beginning of my quest, and walk you through it, documenting my emotions, my reasoning, and my actions.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;"><b style="text-align:left;">The Pledge.</b></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">First I am presented with a banner of simple design, schizophrenically jittering colors...
<i style="text-align:left;">and alluring promise</i>. Are my eyes deceiving me? Such luscious bait wiggling on this line, and yet such a seemingly simple challenge. Could it really be this easy? Ah, but finding out is exactly what will make this adventure such a joy!</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">But before I go about assessing the merit of this 728x90-pixeled riddlemaster's challenge, or even consider a response to the challenge itself, I am met with a familiar adversary.
<i style="text-align:left;">
The Olive Garden</i>. The damnable temptress of Mediterranean fare
<a href="offer.html" style="text-align:left;">has toyed with me before</a>. But my ire is only briefly stoked, and then quickly snuffed out, yielding to the rich, smoky scent of desire.
<i style="text-align:left;">The fucking breadsticks</i>. I consider that maybe adversary is not a suitable word, so much as perhaps
<i style="text-align:left;">adversavory</i>.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">But the crippling lust for an inexhaustible basket of garlicky loaves will not be useful on this perilous voyage. I'll need sharpened wits lest I make a grave misstep and completely fuck this up. Luckily I have the experience previously alluded to. I just have to piece the puzzle together.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">My first reaction was that this young man looked like Tom Hanks. This was further reinforced upon seeing his name among the possible choices! This is good news. I suppose all I have to do is click the...<br style="text-align:left;"/>
<i style="text-align:left;"><br style="text-align:left;"/>
Not so fast.</i></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">I notice that as I let my cursor hover over the three candidates, Tom Cruise, Tom Hanks, and Bruce Willis, the URL each one points to is exactly the same. Dia-fucking-bolical!
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">As I mutter a volume of Italian-specific profanity under my breath towards the unscrupulous Olive Garden, the clockwork upstairs is ticking away. This is
<i style="text-align:left;">part of the test</i>. How will I react to this impasse? Which behavior will curry the most favor with the churlish devil operating this cyberspatial crypto-mindfuck?
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Politics, you will note if you read my previous adventure, plays as big a role as any. You will also note, as will I, that as much rapture it would bring me to enjoy a free meal at the premier bargain-crammer of American families' swollen pasta-holes, I am first and foremost a scientist. Just like Dr. Livingstone, who was likely passionate about his other pursuits like being a missionary and narrowly avoiding the kettles of hungry, barbarous brown men, he was first a scientist. Yes, this may not actually be
<i style="text-align:left;">true</i>. But it is true for me.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">I should
<i style="text-align:left;">test
</i>this system. Misinform, as they say, and document the consequence. I have reserved the most fragile sliver of bandwidth for the possibility that since every link points to the same URL, every answer is correct. But the more dire contingency crowding the airspace in my mind, looming like some dark dirigible flagship for an evil army, is that somehow this banner
<i style="text-align:left;">does
</i>know when I've clicked a wrong answer, and a wrong answer is a hair trigger to release heaps upon smoldering heaps of internet scorn upon me (sometimes known as scornography), and even more importantly, resulting in a profound scarcity of piping, cheese-stuffed veal cutlets, and Caesar salads so big, Livingstone himself could start a fucking tribal
<i style="text-align:left;">cult
</i>inside one if he chose to do so.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">How would it know? Maybe the thing has a kind of mouse pixel tracker, sends this information to our truculent riddleskipper via the more silent 'POST' method, and catalogues your answer as either a correct "Hanks" answer, or an incorrect "Cruise", "Willis", or the letter "O" in the Olive Garden. It very well might then trace your IP and forever blacklist you from ever attempting this offer/brainteaser, or any affiliated one, or even setting foot within a 200 meter radius of anything resembling obscene portions of mass-produced Italian food.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">I've naturally broken into a cold sweat by now. But it soothes my nerves to know I've been here before, and this gives me strength. And with strength, courage. The courage to deliberately attempt to trip this thing up, and supply a wrong answer.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">I click "Tom Cruise". I am greeted with... greeted with...</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">I have trouble scribbling the notes into my trusty Moleskine pad as the tears well up in my quivering eyelids. Pearly Xanadu bathed in misty perfumes of Shangri-La, extending ambrosiatic splendors buoyed on the breath of sylphs and ivory-armed nymphs... can it be??</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="c8440fb46fbfbe33ae1b356d6e4d5cf597792859.jpg" style="height:265px;width:500px;border-width: 0px; "/></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">But I check my excitement, and retire to my empiricist's armchair. It certainly seems that one possibility I accounted for could be true; all answers could be treated as correct. But in the grandeur of the moment, my heart swelling at the sheer munificence of this portal of unattenuated Giving, I find that I'm more willing to call into question my assumption that Tom Hanks was really the right answer. Hell, maybe it was Tom Cruise. What do I know! I've never been that great with faces. But what I know for sure is, here I am staring into the face of legitimate evidence that the response "Tom Cruise" is a one way fucking ticket to linguini heaven. (Tom Cruise sure had funny hair back then!)</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Last time I did this, I blistered through the subsequent process to obtain my prize. Not this time. I will savor every step like it was a scalding mouthful of chicken &#38; gnocchi veronese. I will remind myself that I am doing this for
<i style="text-align:left;">you</i>.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;"><b style="text-align:left;">The Turn.</b></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">After I click the button to claim my dinner, that's when everything changes.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">It is at this point that I turn and say "I don't think we followed the white rabbit out of Kansas anymore, Toto. Let's see how far down this looking glass goes." That's what I
<i style="text-align:left;">would
</i>
have said, if there were anyone to say it to. I just jotted it in my pad with a self-satisfied expression, deciding I would relate it to you folks later. </font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">How far down did it go? Quite far. It just kept on going, in fact. I was met with
<a href="offerslist.jpg" style="text-align:left;">screen after vertically-scrolling screen of first-tier promotional offers</a>. And that was just page one. I truly was like Alice tumbling head over heels after ingesting whatever hallucinogen triggered her Wonderland trip.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Now these all looked like fine offers. You might even argue (and I do, vociferously, by the way) that being lead to this dazzling buffet of discounted trades is reward enough alone for pegging a portrait as a dead ringer for a young Tom Cruise.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">But I'm a man on a mission. Not only am I attempting to optimize the likelihood of landing the gold at the end of the rainbow(tie pasta? Nah, forget it.), I'm also dabbling in some peculiar cross-pollinated form of journalism, and actually reporting on how this all works, and more importantly, how it makes me
<i style="text-align:left;">feel</i>. Isn't that what I was calling this? Journalism? Wait... wasn't I calling it science? Is there even a difference? Hey, let's call it both. I'm adventurous enough for that. Sci-journalism. "Journ" is at the heart of journey, so it's making me feel a lot more fucking adventurous already. I will proceed to fantasize about myself as a plucky scijourneyman with a wind-twitched feather in my cap, and I invite you to as well.
</font>
</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">On my scijourn, I'm faced with questions about how best to enrich the process, and augment my future breadstick intake. I will ask, "Is this best served by doing the bare minimum of 'any one sponsored offer'?" What would that say about me? It might say just about the same thing as if I worked in a family restaurant and only wore the minimum number buttons and silly trinkets on my suspenders required by management. To wit, an opportunity has been missed to truly express myself, and improve the perception of myself towards those who are bankrolling this whole goddamned endeavor. See what I mean about this being mostly about politics?</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Needless to say, I completed every offer on every page. It was grueling work, required dispensing a lot of personally invasive material, but it was worth it.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">I have not covered in detail any of the offers from this "Grand Freefall List", because believe it or not, this is only step fucking one of Olive Garden's program requirements. I'll go into more depth on the palette of main offers which follow.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">The best is yet to come.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;"><b style="text-align:left;">The Prestigious Unrelenting Clusterfuck Siege of Neverending Yet Highly Enticing Semi-Mandatory Offers.</b></font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Now comes the fun part. It's a kind of revolving menu, sort of like in a jukebox, of more detailed offers. It's unclear how many of these are really mandatory to complete the deal. I'd guess at least one, but maybe more. But that's missing the point. If you look closely, there's even more free shit you can snag if you take some of these really choice proposals seriously. I know I did. Every last one.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Here's the first one. A smoking survey! This sounds great. Remember about the political angle. Here, the obvious thing to do is pretend you're a smoker, and that you smoke
<i style="text-align:left;">a lot</i>.</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="96fefcb406a0b74ec29139adf73a3c8d45b9705f.jpg" style="height:769px;width:622px;border-width: 0px; "/></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Notice that in order to make yourself eligible for the 5 grand, you have to certify that everything you said is true. This made me a little nervous, so I used a fake name. I figure this ought to throw off the feds for at least a little while, and still allow me to claim the prize as Mr. E. Johnson, with the liberal use of a fake moustache.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Next up: Holy shit, another 5 grand?? At this rate I'll be a millionaire before I'm ever seated at Olive Garden. How ironic, being exorbitantly wealthy, yet dining at a place where a measly few bucks buys you INFINITY breadsticks. Those populist motherfuckers.
</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="d0afb2975da84b897de2eb86ff0ca46e363a2f01.jpg" style="height:798px;width:697px;border-width: 0px; "/></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">There are a few things to notice about this promotion.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">First ...</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">IT IS A TICKING TIME BOMB!!!</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">It's already down to 12 minutes and 31 seconds before it expires! Jesus Christ, talk about getting here in the nick of time! The other thing to note is that it requires your home phone number. I guess this makes sense, because in the off chance that you get the ringtones instead of the 5K, how else are they going to jack your tones up into your phone? End of argument for me.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Besides, I didn't have a whole lot of time to bat around issues of privacy or misuse of personal information when there was just a little less than
<i style="text-align:left;">a baker's goddamned dozen minutes left to make up my mind</i>. And anyway, you can tell they guard this information with encryption protocols since it masks the numbers with '*' symbols. At least I know the busybody looking over my shoulder isn't going to be making any prank phone calls to me, while an elite team of data guardians handles my digits with velvet gloves afar.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Oh yeah, and I had just enough time to hit the checkbox to nab myself another 10K. Booyeah.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Ok, then things started getting a little weird.</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="05435b460dbb9c93643411d6d2a3b74543a7d4e7.jpg" style="height:694px;width:613px;border-width: 0px; "/></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Diapers? Nobody is a bigger fan of accumulating useless shit through debilitatingly extensive promos than I am, but what am I going to do with diapers?</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">I don't really want to turn down the offer and ruffle any feathers, so I decided to just pretend I only spoke Spanish and ignored the form.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">With the next offer, things got back on a more even keel. What's not to like about being greeted by the warm smile of Ray Romano? I found nothing strange or silly about this promotion at all.
</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="9eecc114b6b30fa61e57020b0878a1a9e5f9b162.jpg" style="height:833px;width:626px;border-width: 0px; "/></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">I felt pretty good about my chances on that one. I was starting to get in a groove. I was feeling good, like there was no tidbit about myself too compromising, embarrassing, or financially lacerating to expose to a conglomerate of vague internet shadow-businesses.
</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">Then this one rolled around and I tipped backwards a bit, crushing my chair comedically. Finally something that addresses my one greatest need. My gaping, unfathomable ignorance of things!</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="67144a51797c41477baf4d520679b7ec70089fd0.jpg" style="height:833px;width:626px;border-width: 0px; "/></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">After filling about another 50 or 60 of these, they started getting pretty weird again.
</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="32160615bc3c34e77cefeb752d56afb01fd44a99.jpg" style="height:833px;width:626px;border-width: 0px; "/></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">And they just kept going downhill.
</font></p>
<p align="center">
<img src="d6377ec626a3904d8577824e2183a8ae5cc00171.jpg" style="height:833px;width:626px;border-width: 0px; "/></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">There didn't appear to be an end in sight to the promos. In fact, I am still on this journey, albeit taking a break, resting on the back of some kind of mythical creature that looks like a turtle. I'm not sure if I'll ever come out, but I'll keep recording what I find. Maybe someone can stop by my place with a few external hard drives to store the volume of cookies, spyware and other temporary files which have gathered on my disc. It's been taxed like an old mule.
</font>
</p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">For now, I will venture that there is no bottom to this heinous spiderhole I've fallen into. Only glittering distractions to slow my descent. Send help.</font></p>
<p style="text-align:left;"><font face="Verdana" style="text-align:left;">And breadsticks.</font></p>
